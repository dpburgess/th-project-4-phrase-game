# th-project-4-phrase-game

A guess the phrase game using OOP. A user tries to guess a secret phrase, but they cannot get more than 4 guesses wrong or they will lose.

# Getting Started

Created several classes to share the logic of the game
Changed the colors of the buttons after they are clicked to be different than the original CSS colors
Changed the highlight color for the letters in the secret phrase to be different than the original CSS colors
Added a CSS transform to scale the phrase letters larger when a letter is guessed correctly
